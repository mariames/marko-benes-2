          In supermarkets and stores, customers make decisions in just a few seconds - that&#39;s why it&#39;s crucial that your
          products are visible, attractive and easily accessible.
        </TextBlock>
        <TextBlock>
          Each design is designed with the aim of highlighting the brand, attracting attention and conveying key messages,
          using a well-thought-out combination of colors, graphics and arrangement of elements. In addition to visual appeal, I
          take care of technical preparation and optimization for production, ensuring that everything looks perfect in the final
          version.
        </TextBlock>
        <TextBlock>
          Promo shelves can be made of cardboard, wood or metal, and each material requires a specific design approach.
          Cardboard shelves are light, flexible and ideal for short-term promotions, while wooden and metal variants provide
          greater durability and a premium look.
        </TextBlock>
        <TextBlock>
          Whether it is displays for promotional products, exclusive collections or long-term setups, the design will be adapted
          to your needs and market requirements.
        </TextBlock>
        <TextBlock>
          Get your products noticed - because good visibility means more sales!
