          I work on a flat fee basis for projects, so I&#39;ll quote you a single project price instead of an hourly rate so
          there&#39;s no hidden fees. Of course, if the need arises for additional work beyond the agreed scope, I will be

          Most of the works showcased on this site took somewhere between 4â€”10 days to complete, and vary in

          meaning every project is different. But as a general rule of thumb, most of my projects tend to range from
          $70&ndash;$1000, again depending on the specifics.
